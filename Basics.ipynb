This gives us the percentage chance that a given person in the White census race category would have been killed by a gun in the US from 2012 to 2014. If I do this computation, I'll see that the rate is a very small number, 0.0003356849303419181. It's for this reason that it's typical to express crime statistics as the \"rate per 100000\". This tells us the number of people in a given group out of every 100000 that were killed by guns in the US. To get this, I just multiply by 100000. This gives us 33.56, which I can interpret as \"33.56 out of every 100000 people in the White census race category in the US were killed by guns between 2012 and 2014\".\n",
